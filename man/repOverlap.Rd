\title{General function for the repertoire overlap evaluation.}
\usage{
repOverlap(.data, .method = c("exact", "hamm", "lev", "jaccard", "morisita",

}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{List of clonesets.}

\item{.method}{Which method to use for the overlap evaluation. See "Details" for methods.}

\item{.seq}{Which clonotype sequences to use for the overlap: "nuc" for "CDR3.nucleotide.sequence", "aa" for
"CDR3.amino.acid.sequence".}

\item{.quant}{Which column to use for the quantity of clonotypes: "read.count" for the "Read.count" column,
"bc.count" for the "Barcode.count" column, "read.prop" for the "Read.proportion" column, "bc.prop" for
the "Barcode.proportion" column. Ignored for all methods excluding "morisita".}
